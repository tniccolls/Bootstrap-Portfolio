          Hello! I'm Tyler Niccolls. I graduated from UC Davis with a bachelor's
          in Economics, but I took a few Computer Science courses along the way.
          Desiring a career change in 2018, I enrolled in a coding BootCamp to
          learn Web Design, and I'm now looking start a career in this field!
          <br />
          <br />
          While attending UC Davis, I began an internship at DMG MORI. I worked
          in procurement, and I thoroughly enjoyed my internship there. I
          returned to a full time position with the company after graduating,
          but as the company changed significantly over the two years I worked
          there, I started looking for other opportunities. <br />
          <br />
          Since I enjoyed the introductory computer science classes I took at UC
          Davis, I considered different career opportunities involving coding,
          and decided on taking the UC Davis Extention Web Design Bootcamp full
          time to quickly develop the skills needed to begin a career in this
          field. And now, I'm glad I did. I love the logical process of coding,
          and enjoy learning new tools and skills everyday to develop as a web
          designer. I find it satisfying to build useful, working applications,
          and hope to build a career doing so. For some examples of projects
          I've worked on and applications I've built, please visit my
          "Portfolio" page.

        <!-- <p> Once, a rattlesnake bit me. After 5 days of excruciating pain, the rattlesnake died. Batman watches Saturday morning cartoons about me. I once had a wrestling match with Superman, and the loser had to wear his underwear on the outside of his pants. My treehouses have fully furnished basements. I once won the world series of poker using Uno cards. When in Rome, they do as I do. I have counted to infinity... twice. I am known to slam revolving doors, and I can win a game of Connect 4 in three moves. </p> -->

        <!-- <p>Now you know a little bit about me. The list above is by no means exhastive- I left out the fact that I am called a fountain of knowledge in a desert of ignorance, and many of the other remarkable and astounding things about me. But that is partly for the sake of brevity, and partly due to what is possibly my most important and defining character trait: I am the epitome of humility, a paradigm of virtue. Therefore, though I am sure you were enthralled by the opportunity to increase your knowledge about me, I will end this section here. If you are curious about any of the facts above, or just have an unquenchable desire for more facts about me, please see the "Contact" page.</p> -->
